TASK ONE:-TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
Objective:
Build a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.

Dataset:
-The dataset contains information such as:
-Age
-Gender
-Passenger Class
-Fare
-SibSp
-Parch

Steps Performed:
-Data Cleaning
-Handling Missing Values
-Encoding Categorical Variables
-Train-Test Split
-Logistic Regression Model

Model Accuracy:
Achieved 81% accuracy on test data.

Conclusion:
The model performs well in predicting passenger survival and demonstrates understanding of classification techniques.

TASK TWO:-MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON
-Objective:
-The goal of this project is to build a machine learning regression model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like:
-Year
-Duration
-Votes
-Genre
Since movie rating is a continuous value (like 6.8, 7.5, 8.2), this is a Regression problem.

Steps Performed:
-Loaded IMDb Movies dataset
-Cleaned Year, Duration, and Votes columns
-Removed missing values
-Encoded Genre using one-hot encoding
-Dropped unnecessary text columns
-Split data into training and testing sets
-Trained a Linear Regression model
-Evaluated model using MAE and R² score

Result:
The model predicts movie ratings with reasonable accuracy using regression techniques.

TASK THREE:-IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
Objective:
Build a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species:
-Setosa
-Versicolor
-Virginica
based on sepal and petal measurements.

Dataset:
-The dataset contains:
-Sepal Length
-Sepal Width
-Petal Length
-Petal Width
-Species

Steps Performed:
-Loaded the Iris dataset
-Separated features and target variable
-Split data into training and testing sets
-Trained Logistic Regression model
-Evaluated model using Accuracy Score and Classification Report

Model Used:
Logistic Regression (Classification)

Result:
The model achieved high accuracy in classifying Iris flower species correctly.

TASK 4:- SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON
Objective:
Predict product sales based on advertising expenditure.

Features Used:
-TV Advertising Budget
-Radio Advertising Budget
-Newspaper Advertising Budget

Model Used:
Linear Regression

Steps Performed:
-Loaded dataset
-Split into training and testing data
-Trained Linear Regression model
-Evaluated using MAE and R² score

Result:
The model predicts sales effectively based on advertising spending.

TASK 5:CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION

Objective:
Build a machine learning model to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.

-Steps Performed:
-Loaded dataset
-Handled class imbalance
-Normalized features
-Split into training and testing sets
-Trained Logistic Regression model
-Evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score

Conclusion:
The model effectively detects fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.
